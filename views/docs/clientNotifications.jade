    h4.subtitle Retry Policies
    p
        | A successful notification delivery to an HTTP/HTTPS endpoint sometimes requires more than one attempt. 
    
    p
        | This can be the case, for example, if the web server that hosts the subscribed endpoint is down for maintenance 
        | or is experiencing heavy traffic.

    p
        | If an initial delivery attempt doesn't result in a successful response from the subscriber, 
        | EvenID attempts to deliver the message again, every quarter hours, 
        strong.stronger over the subsequent 48 hours
        | .

    p
        | EvenID only attempts a retry after a failed delivery attempt. 
        | EvenID considers the following situations as a failed delivery attempt:

    ul
        li
            | An HTTP status code 
            strong.stronger different from 200
            | .
        li
            | A request timeout (
            strong.stronger 5 seconds
            | ).
        li Any connection error such as connection timeout, endpoint unreachable, bad SSL certificate, etc.
